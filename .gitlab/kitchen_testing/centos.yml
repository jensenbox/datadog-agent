# FIXME: our current Gitlab version doesn't support importing a file more than once
# For now, the workaround is to include "common" files once in the top-level .gitlab-ci.yml file
# See: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28987
# include:
#   - /.gitlab/kitchen_testing/testing.yml

# Kitchen: OSes
# -------------

# Used for Agent 5 upgrade tests, as Agent 5 RPMs aren't built to be
# installable in FIPS mode.
